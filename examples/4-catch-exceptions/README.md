# Catch Exceptions from Blockchain APIs

Sometimes the API may return some exceptions.

These exceptions can happen in the following cases:
- An invalid parameter for a request
- If you do more requests than your API key allow you to make
- Your API key is invalid or expired

In this folder you will find examples on how you can catch each of these exceptions
and what you should do with them.
