# How to get the amount out of a swap using Python?

Find 2 examples of code that will simulate the swap of one 1 WETH for USDC using
[Blockchain APIs](https://www.blockchainapis.io)

We advise you to use the [async](get_amount_out.py) version of the code for
better performance.

If you already have a Python project and you don't want to bother with
async Python, you can use the [sync](get_amount_out_sync.py) version.

Feel free to clone the repository and modify the examples to play with the API and
learn how to use it.

## To run the example

### Install the dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run any of the two instances:

_Sync:_
```bash
python get_amount_out.py
```

_Async:_
```bash
python get_amount_out_sync.py
```
