# How to get the amount out of a specific token swap?

[Blockchain APIs](https://www.blockchainapis.io) allow you to get the amount of
tokens that you will receive after executing a trade on the blockchain.

In this example, we will simulate the swap of 1 WETH for USDC. The API will give
us the amount of tokens that we will receive on every dex available.

Running the example should give you this output:

```
dooar_ethereum will give you 1898.311704 USDC
elk_finance_ethereum will give you 213.775165 USDC
pancakeswap_ethereum will give you 1906.054373 USDC
plasmafinance_ethereum will give you 94.209782 USDC
shibaswap_ethereum will give you 1907.634462 USDC
sushiswap_ethereum will give you 1933.364498 USDC
uniswapv2_ethereum will give you 1935.204076 USDC
```
