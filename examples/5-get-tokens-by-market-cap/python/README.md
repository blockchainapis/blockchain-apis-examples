# How to get the market cap of all tokens of a blockchain in Python

Find two examples of code that will give you the first 100 tokens that have the biggest
market cap inside of the Ethereum Blockchain.

We advise you to use the [async](get_tokens_market_cap.py) version of the code for
better performance.

If you already have a Python project and you don't want to bother with
async Python, you can use the [sync](get_tokens_market_cap_sync.py) version.

## To run the example

### Install the dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run any of the two instances:

_Sync:_
```bash
python get_tokens_market_cap_sync.py
```

_Async:_
```bash
python get_tokens_market_cap.py
```

## Example result
