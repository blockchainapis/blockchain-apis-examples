# How to get the decimal of a token in Python

Find two examples of code that will display a token in his decimal form and do the reverse operation (from decimal form to unsigned integer form).

We advise you to use the [async](display_token_in_decimal.py) version of the code for better performance.

If you already have a Python project and you don't want to bother with
async Python, you can use the [sync](display_token_in_decimal_sync.py) version.

## To run the example

### Install the dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run any of the two instances:

_Sync:_
```bash
python display_token_in_decimal_sync.py
```

_Async:_
```bash
python display_token_in_decimal.py
```

## Example result

```
2450000000000000000 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2 in decimal is: 2.45 WETH
2542.42 USDC in unsigned integer form is: 2542420000 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48
```
