# How to get the amount in required for a swap using Python?

Find 2 examples that will give you the amount of ETH required in order to
get 2000 USDC using [Blockchain APIs](https://www.blockchainapis.io) and Python.

We advise you to use the [async](get_amount_in.py) version of the code for
better performance.

If you already have a Python project and you don't want to bother with
async Python, you can use the [sync](get_amount_in_sync.py) version.

Feel free to clone the repository and modify the examples to play with the API and
learn how to use it.

## To run the example

### Install the dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run any of the two instances:

_Sync:_
```bash
python get_amount_in.py
```

_Async:_
```bash
python get_amount_in_sync.py
```
