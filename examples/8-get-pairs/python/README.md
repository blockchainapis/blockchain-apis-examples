# How to get the list of blockchains using Python

Find 2 examples of code that will give you the list of tradable pairs available in [Blockchain APIs](https://www.blockchainapis.io).

We advise you to use the [async](get_pairs.py) version of the code for
better performance.

If you already have a Python project and you don't want to bother with
async Python, you can use the [sync](get_pairs_sync.py) version.

## To run the example

### Install the dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run any of the two instances:

_Sync:_
```bash
python get_pairs_sync.py
```

_Async:_
```bash
python get_pairs.py
```
